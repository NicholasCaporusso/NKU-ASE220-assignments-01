### Summary
I am very new to coding & software development. I am looking forward to becoming more familiar with git over the semester. I have never used it in a real world use case but with my new Co-op position at fischer homes I am excited to learn overlapping material in my courses and in my work. I am familiar with Java, Javascript, Html & CSS, and Python.
