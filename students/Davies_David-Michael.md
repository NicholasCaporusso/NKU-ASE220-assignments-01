### Summary
A brief summary highlighting your professional background, key skills, and career goals.
I am a college junior studying Applied Software Engineering at Northern Kentucky university. My education has led me to take on many things, such as the creation of a random story generator. It began as a simple terminal app coded in Java, but it inspired me to create a full web application of it with the help of a classmate for an ASE class.
