### Summary
I am an Applied Software and Engineering student. I have not worked in the coding field professionally yet, but my experience working as a janitor has helped me gain skills with communication and discipline. However, I have done a lot of coding in school and found that not only do I code very well, but I also enjoy it quite a bit. As for my carreer goals, I hope to find a job that allows me to code something that I am passionate about.

#### [Simple Games]
- In this group project we made a webpage that had three different games available to play: go fish, rock paper scissors, and tictactoe.
- A challenge I came across was that showing a hand for go fish was beyond the scope of the class, so I simply printed out the hand instead.
